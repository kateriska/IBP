This program requests installed Python 3.6 and these libraries:
- numpy (NumPy library)
- cv2 (OpenCV library)
- matplotlib (Matplotlib library)
- skimage (scikit-image library)
- pywt (PyWavelets library)
- sklearn (scikit-learn library)

Libraries can be installed via pip3 and these commands:
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install scikit-image
pip3 install scikit-learn
pip3 install PyWavelets

Other libraries like NumPy or Matplotlib should be installed along with these 4 libraries.

The program is run with command:
python3.6 bt.py <arguments>, where arguments can be following:

1. Extraction of vectors and classification
  -test lbp -s otsu|gauss|mean -clasif ann|svm|dts -img b|g|r|all
  Extraction of vectors based on Local Binary Pattern.
  User chooses Otsu (otsu), Gaussian (gauss) or Mean (mean) thresholding used for segmentation.
  Classification will be processed with chosen Artificial Neural Network (ann), Support Vector Machines (svm) or Decision Trees (dts).
  Possible to process training and testing for images illuminated by blue light (b), green light (g) or red light (r) or user can use whole dataset of all the images illuminated by various lights.

  -test sobel -clasif ann|svm|dts -img b|g|r|all
  Extraction of vectors based on Sobel and Laplacian operator.
  The switch -s is not used for this method, segmentation is processed with Otsu thresholding.

  -test wavelet -t <type> -s otsu|gauss|mean -clasif ann|svm|dts -img b|g|r|all
  Extraction of vectors based on Wavelet transform.
  This vector can be slower to gain, especially for larger datasets. Nevertheless, Discrete Wavelet Transform uses several Wavelet families for experiments.
  Switch -t is used for setting specified wavelet of Wavelet family.
  The wavelets used for experiments were: bior1.3, bior1.5, bior2.4, db2, db4, rbio3.1
  All wavelets supported by PyWavelets library for DWT can be found in Manual attachment of Thesis on page 55.

  The order of arguments is not optional.

2. Display of used techniques
  -show lbp [-s otsu|gauss|mean] -img <path>
  User replaces the variable path for path to image with fingerprint which he wants to analyze.
  This fingerprint is processed by Local Binary Pattern and the result is displayed along with histogram of Local Binary Pattern.

  -show sobel [-s otsu|gauss|mean] -img <path>
  This command displays result of processed fingerprint with Sobel operator on x a y axis and Laplacian operator.

  -show wavelet -t <type> [-s otsu|gauss|mean] -img <path>
  Command displays result after processing fingerprint with Wavelet transform.
  The displayed results are horizontal, vertical, diagonal detail and their approximation.

  -show seg -s otsu|gauss|mean -img <path>
  Displays segmented fingerprint with using of Otsu, Gaussian or Mean thresholding.

  The switch -s for segmentation is compulsory only for last command.
  The order of arguments is not optional.

3. Printing of help
   -help
   Prints help for whole program.

   -test help
   Prints help for Extraction of vectors and classification.

   -show help
   Prints help for Display of used techniques.
